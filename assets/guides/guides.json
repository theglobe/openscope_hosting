While there are transitions from these waypoints onto the ILS, these transitions aren't used often, as vectors are given most of the time. It is possible to clear aircraft for these transitions, at your own discretion through the <code>reroute</code> and <code>route</code> commands. They are named XXXX23/05, depending on the runway configuration. For example, to clear EWG23LA onto the transition from DOMUX to runway 23R, the command would be <code>EWG23LA route DOMUX.DOMUX23.EDDL23R</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airspace\">Airspace</h3>\n<p>The airspace is listed within the German Aeronautical Information Publication under the name of \"Dusseldorf/Köln Bonn\", meaning that the airspace covers Dusseldorf as well as Cologne Bonn.

Due to prevailing east winds, the runways are aligned east west, and frequently operates in an east flow with well-directed winds. This also works well for noise abatement, as the aircraft are naturally departing over the water, rather than over populated areas.</p>\n<p>During periods of high arrival volume, Miami utilizes land-and-hold-short operations (LAHSO) for arrivals on Runway 9 and Runway 12. Typically, Runway 9 arrivals keep the full length, and B737/A320 and similar (or smaller) aircraft land Runway 12 with instructions to hold short of Runway 9. This is most frequently the way the operation is run, though controllers have the ability to change it on the fly.</p>\n<p>During periods of high departure volume, Miami utilizes mostly Runway 8R, with Runway 9 being used for some heavy aircraft, assignment often determined based on parking position.</p>\n<p>MIA does not have any final monitor positions, and thus are unable to conduct simultaneous independent parallel approaches.

It is a civil-military airport on 8,081 acres (3,270 ha) of land. Although the official IATA and ICAO airport codes for Will Rogers World Airport are OKC and KOKC, it is common practice to refer to it as \"WRWA\" or \"Will Rogers\".</p>\n<p>The airport is named for comedian and legendary cowboy Will Rogers, an Oklahoma native who died in an airplane crash near Utqiagvik, Alaska in 1935. The city's other major airport, Wiley Post Airport, along with the Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport in Barrow, Alaska, are named for Wiley Post, who also died in the same crash. Will Rogers World Airport is the only airport to use \"World\" in its designation. Although Will Rogers offers U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) services for customs and immigration, there are currently no scheduled international flights.</p>\n<p>Will Rogers World Airport is the busiest commercial airport in the state of Oklahoma. In 2019, the airport handled nearly 4.42 million passengers, marking the busiest year on record three years in a row. Southwest Airlines carries the most passengers at Will Rogers World Airport, with a market share of nearly 38% as of December 2018.

It was named after Edward \"Butch\" O'Hare, the U.S. Navy's first Medal of Honor recipient during that war. As the first major airport planned after World War II, O'Hare's innovative design pioneered concepts such as concourses, direct highway access to the terminal, jet bridges, and underground refueling systems.</p>\n<p>O'Hare became famous during the jet age, holding the distinction as the world's busiest airport from 1963 to 1998; today, it is the world's sixth-busiest airport, serving 83 million passengers in 2018. In 2019, O'Hare had 919,704 aircraft movements, averaging 2,520 per day, the most of any airport in the world in part because of a large number of regional flights.

After receiving approval from the government to build the airport, 9 years were spent searching for the right location since the airport would have been the largest in the world at the time. It was eventually decided to build the airport in its current location due to lower construction costs than in other locations. They chose to overlook the fact that the area was prone to extreme flooding and dense fog, now a regular cause for delays at the airport. The airport was finally inaugurated in 1949 with 3 runways crossing at 60-degree angles, one of which was closed in 1997 and is now used for long-term aircraft parking.</p>\n<p>Today, Ministro Pistarini International Airport (IATA: EZE, ICAO: SAEZ), known as Ezeiza International Airport, is Argentina's largest international airport, located 22 kilometers southwest of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It is a hub for Aerolíneas Argentinas and LATAM Argentina. It is one of three airports serving Buenos Aires metropolitan area, along with Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (IATA: AEP, ICAO: SABE) and El Palomar Airport (IATA: EPA, ICAO: SADP). The airport is is the country's primary hub for long-haul international flights with flights to every continent, although some domestic flights also operate out of Ezeiza.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aboutbairestma\">About Baires TMA</h2>\n<p>The Baires Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a large, mostly circular area with a radius of 55nm centered at the EZE VOR and a large portion of the Río de la Plata (River Plate / La Plata River) which creates the border between Argentina and Uruguay. The TMA controls flights in and out of Buenos Aires as well as other smaller airports in nearby towns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instrumentprocedures\">Instrument Procedures</h2>\n<p>The procedures in and out of Ezeiza have remained almost identical for the last 30 years, meaning they are a little 'old-fashioned'. Most SIDs follow a 10nm arc around EZE VOR, allowing aircraft to gain some altitude before heading to their departure fixes. The only exception to this rule is the PTA6B departure for aircraft departing from Runway 11 to the East. All the STARs guide aircraft either to the EZE VOR or the Initial Approach Fix of the corresponding runway, to then be vectored onto the ILS by ATC. Procedures contain no climb or descent instructions or altitude restrictions. ATC is therefore entirely responsible for descending and climbing aircraft in and out of the airport. Special attention must be paid to arrivals from the Northeast who follow routes which take them through restricted airspace overhead Buenos Aires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sectorsavailableinopenscope\">Sectors Available in openScope</h2>\n<p><code>Baires Center</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"restrictedairspace\">Restricted Airspace</h2>\n<p>The Baires TMA is home to many restricted areas.

There are also two small restricted areas, SAR03 and SAR10, which cover the helipad at the executive mansion and President's office in Downtown Buenos Aires as well as the President's official residence in the suburb of Olivos.</p>\n<p>There are also several small prohibited areas all around the Terminal Maneuvering Area, most of which surround large power plants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airportsofinterest\">Airports of Interest</h2>\n<h3 id=\"sabe\">SABE</h3>\n<p>Aeroparque Jorge Newbery Airport <br />\n13,363,000 passengers in 2018  <br />\n16nm Northeast of SAEZ  </p>\n<p>Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, located just 2km Northeast of Downtown Buenos Aires on the bank of the Río de la Plata, is a small international airport serving the Buenos Aires metropolitan airport. Despite being significantly smaller, the airport has always handled much more traffic than than Ministro Pistarini International Airport, partly due its proximity to the city and ease of access. Due to increasing demand and lack of space, the government moved all international flights to Ministro Pistarini International Airport in March 2019, with the exception of flights to Uruguay.

The airport's controversial name reflects Argentina's claims of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas). The airport was opened in 1995 with the aim of serving all commercial traffic to Ushuaia. Previously, all traffic was handled by the Ushuaia Aeronautical Base, located just North of SAWH, but it's runway proved to be inadequate for civil aviation, due to its size and orientation. Ushuaia International Airport's only runway (07/25) was designed to comfortably accommodate the numerous Boeing 747s which would fly in from many European cities. Two chartered Air France Concordes also visited Ushuaia in 1999. Although most of the traffic today is made up of domestic flights from other cities in Argentina, it is often used by passengers from all over the world as a cruise-ship gateway to the Antarctic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aboutushuaiatma\">About Ushuaia TMA</h2>\n<p>The Ushuaia Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a relatively small, mostly rectangular area covering the Beagle Channel and the southern part of Tierra del Fuego from the surface up to FL450.

There is just one standard arrival into TNCM, ULUBA1, which takes aircraft from the borders of the TMA onto the VOR Approach for RWY10, although radar vectors are usually given to guide aircraft into Sint Maarten. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sectorsavailableinopenscope\">Sectors Available in openScope</h2>\n<p><code>Juliana TMA</code> from the surface up to FL150</p>\n<h2 id=\"restrictedairspace\">Restricted Airspace</h2>\n<p>There are two restricted areas within the Juliana TMA, stretching from the French side of Saint Martin to nearby island, Saint-Barthélemy, from the ground up to 2600ft. </p>\n<h2 id=\"airportsofinterest\">Airports of Interest</h2>\n<h3 id=\"tffg\">TFFG</h3>\n<p>Grand Case-Espérance Airport  <br />\n5nm Northast of TNCM  </p>\n<p>L'Espérance Airport, also known as Grand Case Airport, is a public use airport located in Grand Case, on the French side of Saint Martin.
